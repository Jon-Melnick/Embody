Embody sends friendly alerts through either your active chrome tab or through a desktop notification. At that time, please take a few minutes to walk around and then when you are ready take a few minutes to meditate. When you are done, the 'Finish' button will restart the timer so that after whatever you chose as the interval time to be, another alert to take a break will appear. If you chose to 'Turn Off' the alerts, they will not show up again until you turn it back on in the chrome extension icon.
